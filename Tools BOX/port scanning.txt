Port scanning your local system
The easiest way to give nmap a try, is by scanning your own system, also known as localhost or by the IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0:
$ nmap 0.0.0.0
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ ) at 2019-08-18 16:16 CDT
Nmap scan report for 0.0.0.0
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 0.0.0.0 are closed

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.08 seconds
Scanning more than 1000 ports

$ nmap 0.0.0.0 -p1-65535
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ ) at 2019-08-18 16:27 CDT
Nmap scan report for 0.0.0.0
Host is up (0.000092s latency).
Not shown: 65525 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
3000/tcp  open  ppp
6380/tcp  open  unknown
17500/tcp open  db-lsp
17600/tcp open  unknown
17603/tcp open  unknown
27017/tcp open  mongod
34394/tcp open  unknown
38811/tcp open  unknown
57621/tcp open  unknown
59126/tcp open  unknown
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.15 seconds

If you wanna do a port scan on a remote desktop Just swap out the 0.0.0.0 in the previous example for the IP address or domain name of the server you would like to scan.
Do you want to discovering hosts on your network??
To scan your network, simply pass in the IP address range you’d like nmap to scan Example: $ nmap -sP 192.168.1.1/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org/ ) at 2019-08-18 16:40 CDT
Nmap scan report for router.asus.com (192.168.1.1)
Host is up (0.0022s latency).
Nmap scan report for galagopro (192.168.1.14)
Host is up (0.00015s latency).
Nmap scan report for Roomba-3165050862320680 (192.168.1.74)
Host is up (0.0011s latency).
Nmap scan report for Dumbo (192.168.1.81)
Host is up (0.038s latency).
Nmap scan report for josh-iMac (192.168.1.138)
Host is up (0.074s latency).
Nmap scan report for Philips-hue (192.168.1.222)
Host is up (0.0068s latency).
Nmap scan report for amazon-aac753ead (192.168.1.243)
Host is up (0.021s latency).
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (7 hosts up) scanned in 2.59 seconds

nmap:
.Is_nmap_Legal
Yes. If used properly, Nmap helps protect your network from hackers, because it allows you to quickly spot any security vulnerabilities in your systems.

Whether port scanning on external servers is legal is another issue. The legislation in this area is complex and varies by territory. Using Nmap to scan external ports can lead to you being banned by your ISP, so make sure you research the legal implications of using the program before you start using it more widely.
How Does Nmap Work?
Nmap builds on previous network auditing tools to provide quick, detailed scans of network traffic. It works by using IP packets to identify the hosts and IPs active on a network and then analyze these packets to provide information on each host and IP, as well as the operating systems they are running
This is a little nmap tutorial
nmap is a network scanning tool, where you can scan ip, port, ip ranges, and get information
# nmap -sp [ip]/(port)
nmap -sp <target IP range>
namp -sL <IP address>
OS Scanning
OS scanning is one of the most powerful features of Nmap. When using this type of scan, Nmap sends TCP and UDP packets to a particular port, and then analyze its response. It compares this response to a database of 2600 operating systems, and return information on the OS (and version) of a host.

To run an OS scan, use the following command:
nmap -O <target IP>
nmap --top-ports 20 192.168.1.106
Disable DNS Name Resolution
Finally, you can speed up your Nmap scans by using the -n parameter to disable reverse DNS resolution. This can be extremely useful if you want to scan a large network. For example, to turn off DNS resolution for the basic ping scan mentioned above, add -n:

nmap -sp -n 192.100.1.1/24
MISC:
  -6: Enable IPv6 scanning
  -A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
  --datadir <dirname>: Specify custom Nmap data file location
  --send-eth/--send-ip: Send using raw ethernet frames or IP packets
  --privileged: Assume that the user is fully privileged
  --unprivileged: Assume the user lacks raw socket privileges
  -V: Print version number
  -h: Print this help summary page.
EXAMPLES:
  nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org
  nmap -v -sn 192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8
  nmap -v -iR 10000 -Pn -p 80
:sudo nmap -sS (host)(-sS means stelth scan, or halfopen scan this means that it will only do a 2 connections insted of 3 (3 way handshake))
:sudo nmap -sT (host)(-sT meaing do the full scan, the 3 way handshake SYN, SYNACK, ACK. For doing a full scan by esableshing a connection))

SSL:
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable information or with payroll information).
